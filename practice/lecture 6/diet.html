    <p>
      A weight gain diet emphasizes calorie-dense, nutrient-rich foods like
      nuts, dried fruits, whole grains, full-fat dairy, avocados, red meat, and
      starchy vegetables, focusing on a consistent caloric surplus to gain
      weight healthily. Combining meals with calorie-rich snacks like smoothies,
      protein shakes, and full-fat yogurts helps increase intake, while
      incorporating strength training promotes muscle gain, not just fat.

    <p>
      A diet for weight loss involves creating a calorie deficit by eating fewer
      calories than you burn, prioritizing nutrient-dense foods like vegetables,
      protein, and whole grains, and staying hydrated. Key strategies include
      focusing on portion control, limiting processed foods and sugary drinks,
      incorporating physical activity, and practicing mindful eating
