      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <h2>Networks:</h2>
      <p>
        A network is a system of two or more interconnected entities, such as
        computers, servers, or other devices, that communicate and share
        information and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a group of interconnected computers or devices to have
        communication within themselves. A computer network consists of a
        collection of computers, printers and other equipment that is connected
        together so that they can communicate with each other.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem with temporary solution:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider, computer (A) wants to sends data to computer B.</li>
        <li>
          It uses pendrive. But there are more computers comes into picture.
        </li>
        <li>It uses wires. But again more computer comes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Permanent Solution (Switch & Router):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If we use wires then it will be mess. That is why we use switch.
        </li>
        <li>Single switch system called LAN.</li>

        <li>Two or more LAN an be connectced through Routers.</li>
        <li>
          Whenever we go out from the network than our device IP address will
          convert to Router IP address because other network can also have same
          device IP address.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Types of Networks:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          PAN (Personal Area Network): Connects a small number of devices, such
          as a mouse, keyboard, or headphones, to a single computer or user.
        </li>
        <li>
          LAN (Local Area Network): Links devices within a limited area, like a
          home, office building, or school.
        </li>

        <li>
          MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Spans a city or large campus,
          connecting several LANs together.
        </li>
        <li>
          WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects devices and networks over large
          geographical distances, such as continents or even globally, with the
          internet being the largest example.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Internet:</h2>
      <p>
        The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that
        enables the exchange of information between devices worldwide. It
        functions as a vast network of networks, allowing for communication,
        access to information via the World Wide Web, email, and other services.
        Data travels in small "packets" over various physical infrastructure,
        including cables and wireless signals, to facilitate communication at
        the speed of light. It is used to communicate two device or transfer
        data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking
        infrastructure. With the help of the internet one can easily be in touch
        with any one in the whole world by sending electronic mail, by chatting.
        Travel bookings can be made very easily, one can order books or buy
        anything online. In simple terms it can be said that internet provides a
        people and their working close to each other
      </p>

      />
      <ul>
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <li>
          The Internet has one very simple job: to move computerized information
          (known as data) from one place to another. The Internet is generally
          defined as a global network connecting millions of computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Standardized Protocols: It relies on the Internet protocol suite (like
          TCP/IP) to ensure different networks and devices can communicate
          effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packet Switching: Data is broken down into small packets, sent across
          the network, and reassembled at the destination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Networking Infrastructure: Computers connect to the internet through
          various technologies like physical wires, fiber-optic cables, and
          wireless radio waves.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>
        Computer A wants to sends data to Computer B and Computer B wants to
        sends data to Computer A
      </p>

      <h2>IP (Internet Protocol)</h2>
      <p>
        Definition: An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique
        string of numbers assigned to each device connected to a computer
        network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as
        an identifier that allows devices to send and receive data over the
        network, ensuring that this data reaches the correct destination.
      </p>
      <h3>Structure of the address:</h3>
      <img
        src="./images/IP1.png"
        height="120px"
        width="400px"
        alt="Structure of IP address with example"
      />
      <p>It is the address of any device. Dynamic in nature.</p>
      <p>
        Whenever internet is on, IP address is given to your device. When your
        internet is off, your device's IP address is taken. And that IP address
        can be provide to other device too.
      </p>
      <h3>Working of web:</h3>
      <img
        src="./images/Working of web Example.png"
        height="250px"
        width="600px"
        alt="Working of web with example"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Computer A types coderArmy.in on the browser. Since it connects with
          internet. So, it have IP address which is provided by ISP(Internet
          Service Provider) such as jio, airtel, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          As we know, we want server IP address but we don't know about coder
          army server IP address.
        </li>
        <li>DNS is the book which is contains list of IP address of all.</li>
        <li>
          Before connecting with server computer A connects with DNS & have
          appropriate IP address. Then, it connects with computer B which sends
          file (Html, css, js).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="./images/Working of web.png"
        height="300px"

      />
      <h3>Types of IP Address:</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4><li>IPv4</li></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is a 32-bit numerical address
            system that uniquely identifies devices on a network and is
            fundamental to the functioning of the internet and other
            packet-switched networks. It uses four sets of numbers, each ranging
            from 0 to 255, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Problem: The main challenge with IPv4 is the limited number of
            available addresses, which has been insufficient for the growing
            number of connected devices.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            To extend the life of IPv4, NAT technology is used to allow multiple
            devices on a private network to share a single public IP address,
            conserving the limited public address space.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Solution:To overcome the limitations of IPv4 entirely, IPv6 was
            developed, offering a vastly larger address space of 128 bits.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4><li>IPv6</li></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, is the latest version of the
            Internet Protocol that provides a vastly larger address space than
            the older IPv4 to accommodate the growing number of connected
            devices on the internet
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Importances:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                Addresses IPv4 exhaustion: The primary reason for IPv6's
                development was to overcome the limited address space of IPv4,
                which was rapidly running out as more devices connected to the
                internet.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Supports future growth: The large address pool of IPv6 is
                essential for the future growth of the internet, supporting
                everything from smartphones to smart home devices and IoT
                sensors.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Improved network functionality: By providing more addresses,
                IPv6 ensures that every new device can be assigned a unique IP
                address, facilitating seamless communication and data transfer.

      <h3>Public IP Address and Private IP Address</h3>
      <p>
        A public IP address is a unique global address, assigned by an ISP, that
        identifies your entire network to the internet, enabling communication
        with external services. In contrast, a private IP address is assigned by
        your router to individual devices (like a phone or laptop) within your
        local network and is only visible and used internally for communication
        between devices on that network. Your router acts as a gateway, using
        its public IP to connect to the internet while assigning private IPs to
        your local devices.
      </p>
      <table border="1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Features</th>

            </td>
            <td>
              Reusable and not unique outside the private network; many devices
              on different networks can share the same private IP addresses.

      <h3>Why is Public IP Address and Private IP Address came?</h3>
      <p>
        Because IPv4 only have 4.3 Billion IP. So, it is suggested to have
        private & public IP which leads to the large number of IP.
      </p>

      <h2>DNS (Domain Name System) Server</h2>
      <p>
        DNS, or the Domain Name System, works by translating human-friendly
        domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-friendly IP addresses
        (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to locate websites and other
        resources on the internet
      </p>

      <p>
        Human are more fimiliar with the name of the webiste i.e domain name.
        Human can learn domain name easily. But to access the website we
        required IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        DNS acts as the interface between the client and server. DNS have all
        website domain name with it's IP address.
      </p>

      <h3>DNS works:</h3>

        alt="DNS work"
      />

      <ol>
        <li>
          Client/User sends request to the server with Domain name. For acessing
          the server Client requires IP address. So, it directs to the DNS
          resolver.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          DNS resolver have 3 steps to access the IP.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Root Server: Resolver first contacts the Root DNS Server which is
              the starting point for DNS lookups. The Root server doesn't know
              the exact IP address of any website. It's checks for the
              .extension (.com, .org, .gov, .in, etc.). and send it to the TLD
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              TCD Server: Resolver sends the query to the TLD Server for
              .extension domains. The TLD server handles domain names ending in
              .extension and knows where to find the authoritative nameserver
              for particular website.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Authoritative Domain Server: The Resolver then queries the
              authoritative nameserver for particular website. This server is
              responsible for storing DNS records for the domain, including the
              mapping of the domain name to its IP address.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          After getting the IP address, now we can access the website (server).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>DNS steps-by-steps Process with example:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Client/User sends request to the server with Domain name. For acessing
          the server Client requires IP address. So, it directs to the DNS
          resolver.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          DNS Resolver:
          <ul>

              Root Server:
              <ol type="i">
                <li>Resolver first contacts the Root DNS Server</li>
                <li>
                  The Root server doesn't know the exact IP address of
                  example.com but directs the query to the Top-Level Domain
                  (TLD) Server responsible for .com.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <br />

                <li>
                  The TLD server handles domain names ending in .com and knows

      <h3>DNS types:</h3>
      <p>
        You'll use DNS all day everyday, but did you know there are two
        different forms of DNS query, recursive and iterative. Understanding how
        these work ensures that you understand how clients will be using your
        DNS server(s) and what access they might need to external DNS servers
        and therefore how that would affect things like firewall configuration.
        So let’s explore the two types:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong> Iterative way:</strong> An iterative DNS query is a type of
          query where the DNS server who recieved your query won’t do the leg
          work, but will give you a referral to a DNS server that might have the
          answer; in this case your DNS client would need to do all the leg work
          needed to get you the answer, which basically means following all the
          referrals.
        </li>

        <img
          src="./images/Iterative_DNS.png"
          height="300px"
          width="500px"
          alt="Iterative_DNS"
        />
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong> Recursive way:</strong> A recursive DNS query is a type of
          query where the DNS server who recieved your query will do all the leg
          work needed to get you the answer (i.e. go off and ask other DNS
          servers) and then give you the result.
        </li>
        <img
          src="./images/Recursive_DNS.png"
          height="300px"
          width="500px"
          alt="Recursive_DNS"
        />
      </ol>

      <h2>Mac (Media Access Control) Address</h2>
      <h3>Problem:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Since we know IP address is dynamic in nature. Consider computer A
          sends request and due to unwanted stituation computer A disconnect
          with Internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          And server was late to process things (for 5 minutes), after the
          process server sends to the same IP address which was sent request.
        </li>
        <li>
          But we know computer A is isconnected then that same IP address is
          givento someone less & that proess from server will be send to someone
          less.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Solution (mac address):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mac address is permenant to any device (unique address).</li>
        <li>
          A MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique, permanent serial
          number burned into every network-capable piece of hardware (your
          laptop's Wi-Fi card, your phone, your smart TV, the network port on
          your desktop).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Structure of the address:</h3>
      <img
        src="./images/Mac_Address.png"
        height="100px"
        width="500px"
        alt="Mac_Address"
      />
      <h3>Mac Address Format:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All the ways in which data can be transferred are included in the mac
          address.
        </li>
        <li>We have many Mac address in one device.</li>
        <li>48 bits, hexadecimal format.</li>
        <li>
          Wecan transfer data through bluetooth, pendrive, wifi, etc. means many
          ways that is nothing but a Mac address.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Port Number</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is used to tell where to diplay website (in which tab to be
          display).
        </li>
        <li>It is 16 bits and unsigned.</li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="./images/port_number_example.png"
        height="150px"
        width="500ppx"
        alt="port_number_example"
      />
      <h3>Structure of the address:</h3>
      <img
        src="./images/port_number.png"
        height="100px"
        width="500px"
        alt="structure of port_number"
      />
      <h3>Types of ports:</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4><li>Well-known Port Number</li></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These are the VIPs of the port world. They are reserved for the most
            common, fundamental, and standardized internet services.
          </li>
          <li>Controlled By: Strictly managed by IANA.</li>
          <li>
            Privileges: On most operating systems (like Linux and macOS), you
            need administrator (root or sudo) privileges to run a program that
            listens on these ports. This is a security measure to prevent rogue
            applications from impersonating standard services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h4><li>Registered Ports</li></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These ports are for specific applications or services that are not
            as universal as the "well-known" ones. Companies and developers can
            register a port for their software to avoid conflicts with other
            applications.
          </li>
          <li>Controlled By: Less strict. You can request a port from IANA.</li>
          <li>
            Privileges: You do not need administrator privileges to use these
            ports. This is the "user space" for applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4><li>Dynamic / Private / Ephemeral Ports</li></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These ports are not meant for public-facing servers. Their job is
            completely different.
          </li>
          <li>Controlled By: No one. They are for temporary, private use.</li>
          <li>
            Purpose: When your web browser (the client) makes a request to a
            server (e.g., to google.com on port 443), your computer's operating
            system needs to assign a temporary source port for its side of the
            conversation. It grabs a random, unused port from this high-numbered
            range for the duration of that single connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Key Takeaway: You never configure your server applications to listen
            on these ports. They are used automatically by the client side of a
            connection.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
