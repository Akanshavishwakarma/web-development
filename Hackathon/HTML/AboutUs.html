      <p>
        My name is Akansha Vishwakarma, and I am a final-year BCA student with a
        CGPA of 9+.A curious mind and a problem-solver at heart, I am passionate
        about software development. I hold a 9.36/10 CGPA in my first year and
        bring skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with experience in Core
        Java, C, C++, and MySQL. I thrive on challenges, treating every unknown
        as an opportunityâ€”if I don't know it, I'll master it. I am eager to
        explore new technologies and collaborate on impactful projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I actively share my learning journey and projects on LinkedIn and
        GitHub, consistently posting about what I explore and build. At present,
        I am following a Defence course, and alongside that, I have created
        handwritten notes on System Design, which are available in PDF format on
        my GitHub. I have also shared these resources on LinkedIn and Twitter
        for easy access.
