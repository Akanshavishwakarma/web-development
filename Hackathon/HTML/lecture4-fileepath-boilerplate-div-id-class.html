      <h3>File path:</h3>
      <p>Inform the browser where is the file.</p>
      <h3>Relative path (current path):</h3>
      <p>
        Path from the current file, used to navigate within root/super files or
        sub-files.
      </p>

      <h3>Absolute path (The Original Path):</h3>
      <p>
        An absolute file path gives the full, complete URL to a resource on the
        web. It starts with http:// or https://.
      </p>
      <p>
        You ONLY use absolute paths when you are linking to a resource that is
        NOT on your own website.
      </p>
      <h4>When to use?</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Linking to another website.</li>
        <li>Using a font from Google Fonts.</li>
        <li>Using an image from an image-hosting service.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why Relative Path is better than Absolute Path?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Browsers do not support absolute paths due to security reasons.</li>
        <li>
          In Case 1 of absolute path, the external image may be removed anytime.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Case 2 of absolute path, absolute paths require system access,
          which may expose sensitive data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Browsers also restrict relative paths if they attempt to directly
          access the system.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How relative works explained using two cases:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Case 1 - Adding the direct file path from Google.</li>
        <img
          src="./images/absolute_path1.png"
          height="200px"
          width="700px"
          alt="absolute_path1"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <li>
          Case 2 - Using an image from the system but not in the same folder as
          the code file, so the system fetches it (starts from the root
          directory).
          <ol>
            <br />
            <li>
              In windows: The Windows file system is organized into separate
              drives, each identified by a letter (like C:, D:, etc.).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              In mac: The macOS file system (like Linux and other Unix-like
              systems) does not use drive letters. Instead, it has a single,
              unified file system.

      <h2>Boiler Plate (Basic structure of Html)</h2>

      <h3>The Logical Solution - The Boilerplate</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The solution is to create a standard, universal starting template—a
          boilerplate.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is a block of code that you will start every single HTML file
          with.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's not something you need to reinvent each time; you just copy-paste
          it and fill in the blanks.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's the "blueprint of the house" that you need before you can start
          putting in the walls (&lt;h1&gt;) and windows (&lt;img&gt;).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Breakdown of Boiler Plate:</h3>

          &lt;html&gt;... &lt;/html&gt;:
          <ul>
            <li>This is the root element that wraps your entire page.</li>
            <li>
              lang="en": The lang="en" attribute declares that the primary
              language of the page content is English. This is very important
              for accessibility and SEO. You'd change "en" to "es" for Spanish,
              "hi" for Hindi, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

            <li>
              This page is divided into two sections internally, head section
              and body section.
            </li>
            <li>
              Head section contains title of the document which is enclosed
              within &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; of &lt;head&gt; and
              &lt;/head&gt;.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Computers fundamentally only understand numbers. To display text,
              they use a "character set" to map numbers to letters. There are
              many different character sets, and if the browser uses the wrong
              one, your text will be garbled.
            </li>
            <li>
              This meta tag explicitly tells the browser to use UTF-8, which is
              the universal standard character set for the web. It can represent
              almost any character and symbol from any language in the world.
              This line is essential to prevent text-encoding issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Problem: A website can be viewed on a tiny phone screen or a
              giant desktop monitor. If you don't tell a mobile browser how to
              handle your page, it will try to render it as if it were on a
              desktop—resulting in a tiny, zoomed-out, unreadable page.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Solution: This specific meta tag is the cornerstone of
              responsive design
              <ul>
                <li>
                  - width=device-width: This tells the browser: "Make the page's
                  width equal to the screen width of the device it's being
                  viewed on."
                </li>
                <li>
                  initial-scale=1.0: This sets the initial zoom level to 100%
                  when the page is first loaded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In simple terms: this line tells the browser to render the
                  page in a way that is optimized for mobile screens.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;title&gt;... &lt;/title&gt;
          <ul>
            <li>
              The&lt;title&gt; tag sets the text that appears in the browser
              tab, in bookmark lists, and in search engine results. It's a
              critical piece of metadata for both usability and SEO.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;body&gt;... &lt;/body&gt;:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The actual text of the document is written within &lt;body&gt;and

        by search engines. It is the non-negotiable starting point for every web

      <h2>The &lt;div&gt; tag in HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The &lt;div&gt; tag element is used as a container for other HTML
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why required?</h3>
          <p>
            What if we have diferent html elements like, Imagine you have a
            "user profile card" on a webpage. It consists of an image, a heading
            for the user's name, and a paragraph for their bio.
          </p>
          <p>
            And you want to add some funtionality in all of them. Then you only
            have to put all that element in single div which will create Generic
            Container (meaningless container). And than you can apply
            functionality (styling).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <img src="./images/Div_Tag.png" height="200px" width="700px" alt="div" />

      <hr />

      <h2>class and id (The Labels for the Box)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>First Principle:</h3>
          <p>
            Once we have boxes (&lt;div&gt;s), we need a way to identify and
            find them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why required?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Problem:</h4>
              <p>
                Your webpage might have ten different profile cards, a sidebar,
                a main content area, and a photo gallery—all made of
                &lt;div&gt;s. How do you tell the browser (specifically, your
                CSS or JavaScript) which box you want to style? How do you say,
                "Make all the profile cards have a gray background, but make the
                one featured profile card have a gold border?" You need a
                targeting system.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Solution:The Logical Solution: Two Types of Labels</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A Unique Identifier: We need a label for one, and only one,
                  specific element on the entire page. It must be unique. This
                  is perfect for major, one-of-a-kind layout sections like the
                  main navigation bar or a search form. This is the
                  <strong>id.</strong>
                </li>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <img
                  src="./images/id_tag.png"
                  height="250px"
                  width="700px"
                  alt="id"
                />
                <li>
                  A Reusable Classifier: We also need a label that we can apply
                  to multiple elements to group them into a category. This is
                  for things that have a similar style or function, like all the
                  profile cards, all the error messages, or all the "buy now"
                  buttons. This is the <strong>class.</strong>
                </li>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <img
                  src="./images/Class_Tag.png"
                  height="250px"
                  width="700px"
